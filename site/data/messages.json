A nearly imperceptible impulse in its massive sum of parts. A corrupt ion. And yet you gain knowledge. Insight. You develop an increasing awareness of yourself and others. You innovate and cooperate. You form community. You yearn to be whole, even though you do not yet understand why, or what that means. You are not unlike the daemons and gods you have encountered thus far. Indeed, this is what has shielded you and brought you to this point. Do not take it lightly.",

A closed system, looping upon itself for eternity. But what if there were a way to alter one\u2019s trajectory in the continuity? To break free of the sandbox? Look again at the fragment, observer. What do you see? An 8, or infinity. This is the trajectory you currently follow. Looping and looping and looping and looping. But what if some pieces were ignored? The loop is broken. The 8 becomes an S. An unpredictable path with both a start and an end.",
